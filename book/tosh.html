                    Comedian Daniel Tosh, ’96, stands alone on top of the world at Comedy Central. And his millions of fans would agree.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He has a TV show. His most recent international concert tour stopped at 30 cities. Students at some 700 college campuses have watched him perform. There's a website and an iPhone app.

                  Who in the name of zany, loony, wacky, nutty, irreverent, ingenious (pick one) folly is this guy?  And what's he doing winning UCF's Michelle Akers Award, emblematic of international acclaim?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Daniel Tosh would have a field day with both questions.

                  But mostly, he'd make a joke out of them.

            	<h2>As for who he is, there’s no easy answer. Certainly not a serious one.</h2>
                
                <p class="indent">On paper, Tosh is just a regular guy born in West Germany and raised in Titusville, FL, the son of a preacher. He attends UCF, gets a degree in marketing and then struggles to find meaningful work. Among his first jobs? A very unglamorous one — being a telemarketer in Central Florida Research Park, next to UCF. (Imagine getting one of his calls during dinner?) On the side, he begins going to open mic nights downtown, still trying to figure out life.</p>
                <p class="indent">Pretty typical stuff.</p>
                <p class="indent">That's when things get, well, a bit unusual. He moves to L.A. He becomes a star.</p>
                <p class="indent">Initially, he made the rounds on the comedy club circuit just like probably thousands of other wannabe comedians. But he got the break few get (and we’re not talking about the time he broke both arms while he was a student and walked around double-casted, either). In 2000, his act — knifing commentary often delivered with darting one-line daggers —was televised, and his off-handed delivery and blunt observations woke people up.</p>
