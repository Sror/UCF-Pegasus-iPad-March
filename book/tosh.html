                    Comedian Daniel Tosh, ’96, stands alone on top of the world at Comedy Central. And his millions of fans would agree.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He has a TV show. His most recent international concert tour stopped at 30 cities. Students at some 700 college campuses have watched him perform. There's a website and an iPhone app.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Who in the name of zany, loony, wacky, nutty, irreverent, ingenious (pick one) folly is this guy?  And what's he doing winning UCF's Michelle Akers Award, emblematic of international acclaim?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Daniel Tosh would have a field day with both questions.

                  But mostly, he'd make a joke out of them.

                	Tosh regularly gives a “Web Redemption” to someone who’s had a what-was-I-thinking moment, like Caitlin Upton, Miss South Carolina (of Miss Teen USA 2007), who famously blundered, “...such as South Africa and the Iraq, everywhere like such as...” </p>
                 <p id="videoCaption" class="caption">
                 	In addition, he puts “20 Seconds on the Clock,” where he gives 20 seconds of quick-witted commentary about a specific clip.

           	  <h2>As for who he is, there’s no easy answer. Certainly not a serious one.</h2>
                <br/>
                <p class="indent">On paper, Tosh is just a regular guy born in West Germany and raised in Titusville, FL, the son of a preacher. He attends UCF, gets a degree in marketing and then struggles to find meaningful work. Among his first jobs? A very unglamorous one — being a telemarketer in Central Florida Research Park, next to UCF. (Imagine getting one of his calls during dinner?) On the side, he begins going to open mic nights downtown, still trying to figure out life.</p>
                <p class="indent">Pretty typical stuff.</p>
                <p class="indent">That's when things get, well, a bit unusual. He moves to L.A. He becomes a star.</p>
                <p class="indent">Initially, he made the rounds on the comedy club circuit just like probably thousands of other wannabe comedians. But he got the break few get (and we’re not talking about the time he broke both arms while he was a student and walked around double-casted, either). In 2000, his act — knifing commentary often delivered with darting one-line daggers —was televised, and his off-handed delivery and blunt observations woke people up. Was it his wicked dry wit? Yes. The “I can’t believe he just said that” factor? That too. Whatever it was, there was buzz. He got a spot on the Late Show with David Letterman. In the world of entertainment that’s akin to landing on the moon five years out of school. Letterman was followed by performances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Comedy Central’s Premium Blend. He also served as a spokesperson in Taco Bell commercials. </p>
                <p class="indent">Stardom.</p>
                <p class="indent">The fun (or foolishness) didn’t stop there. In 2003, he performed in his own 30-minute special on Comedy Central Presents. In 2005, he released an album, True Stories I Made Up, and in 2007, Comedy Central aired his stand-up special: Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious. By that time, Tosh had won over audiences with his unique brand of stand-up comedy. His casual style and sharp material proved to be a winner among young and old (but mostly young).</p>

            	<p class="indent">Even bigger (pay) days were coming though, in the form of Tosh.0.</p>
                <p class="indent">His Comedy Central TV show premiered in June 2009 and showcased Internet video clips (OK, downloadable debaucheries) and a type of mocking humor that didn’t just push the envelope. It pushed it and ran it through the shredder. Twice. The show was a hit. </p>
                <p class="indent">Last year, with viewership totaling 2.2 million, Tosh made more news for beating both Comedy Central superstars Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert in ratings, making Tosh.0 the highest-rated, non-animated show on the network. In March, his Comedy Central special Happy Thoughts premiered with 3.25 million viewers. And in June, Comedy Central announced that the fourth season of Tosh.0 will begin Jan. 26.</p>
                <p class="indent">Calling Tosh.0 “cable TV’s most trusted source for exhibitionist weirdoes, injurious idiots and all things Web,” Comedy Central clearly finds the show a laughing matter. Network brass quipped, “Daniel is still trying to figure out what his show is, and we thought it would only be right to give him another season to work it out, especially since so many millions of people are watching it.” And they’re not kidding: The expected return is more than 4 million viewers, mostly in the highly appealing advertiser market of men ages 18 to 34.</p>
                <p class="indent">For good measure, the Tosh.App is now out, arriving with warnings of “frequent/intense profanity or crude humor.” He has a Twitter following of roughly 2.3 million (he live tweets during his show).</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, the über-popular Tosh.0 blog operates 24/7/365 and is one of Comedy Central’s most-visited properties, featuring such video gems as “Baby Swinging Lady” and “Tumor Head Guy.” (You can’t make this stuff up.) Tosh.0 on Facebook currently has 5.5 million fans.	</p>
                <p class="indent">Now, about that Michelle Akers Award? For UCF, 5.5 million fans is a whole lot of recognition.</p>
                <p class="indent">All the while, Tosh doesn’t take himself too seriously (of course not). While his act frequently contains punch lines that can be considered racist, sexist or homophobic, Tosh is not. His explanation of his non-politically correct humor? “I’m not a misogynistic and racist person. … But I do find those jokes funny, so I say them.”</p>
                <p class="indent">His mother calls after watching the show to get explanations about some of the jokes. His parents have to prepare themselves for what people might say to them during the following week. His mother doesn’t like him referencing sex or pornography, and his father doesn’t like him poking fun at religion, but “they get the fact that I’ve got to make fun of everything.”</p>
                <p class="indent">Oddly, the closest he comes to a serious topic is his admission of having social anxiety. Just imagine.</p>
                <p class="indent">And when he looks ahead, he doesn’t peer too far. Tosh says he plans to end his career on his 38th birthday, May 29, 2013. He even keeps a countdown clock on his website, www.DanielTosh.com, which gives the number of days, minutes and seconds until that fateful day. </p>
                <p class="indent">Strange, for sure. But typical Tosh.</p>

                <p>Daniel Tosh's years at UCF were filled with signs of stardom. Just kidding. Actually, Tosh says he selected UCF because “it was affordable and I could still surf.” He also jokes that he focused on marketing because “it was the easiest major” and remembers UCF as an overall “positive experience.” He even traces his career direction back to UCF. While living at the Lake Claire Apartments, he decided to eschew the real world for comedy. </p>
