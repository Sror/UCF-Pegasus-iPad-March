            	<h3>Morgridge International Reading Center Opening</h3>
                	<p>At a new, state-of-the-art building at the University of Central Florida, students, parents and teachers gather to address an issue that impacts billions of children and adults throughout the world: illiteracy. The Morgridge International Reading Center, part of UCF’s College of Education, serves as a resource for the art, craft and science of teaching reading. Its purpose is to advance international literacy through research, collaboration and community involvement. “The center serves as a hub where scholars, students, parents, educators and policy makers from every continent can–together–delve into challenges that keep so much of the world’s population from gaining command of the written and spoken word,” said Sandra Robinson, dean of the College of Education.</p>
