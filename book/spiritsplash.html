                    <h3>The one day a year when students can get in the Reflecting Pond without hesitation.</h3>
                    <p>The sacred roundabout walk in the Student Union. The must-have snapshot with the man in gold. These are what great traditions are made of.</p>
                    <p>From Spirit Splash to not treading on the Pegasus seal to getting the perfect picture with Knightro, UCF students and alumni are (slowly but surely) establishing lasting traditions for future generations of black and gold. </p>
                    <p>Some are unique, and some are not, but they’ve all got their own distinct Knight flair. Remember and celebrate more than four decades of being UCF Knights…</p>

                    <p class="boldCaption">This year, UCF’s Spirit Splash received the best campus tradition award from the National Association for Campus Activities. It has also been hailed as the best university tradition in the state by Florida Leader magazine. This wet and wild afternoon has been a Knight tradition for the past 15 years. On the Friday before the Homecoming football game, students celebrate by charging into the Reflecting Pond while UCF’s cheerleaders and the Marching Knights cheer them on. This is the only day of the year that students are allowed in the pond.</p>

					<p class="boldCaption">Sir Knight battled a fire-breathing dragon in front of the library in 1981; then the parade moved to downtown Orlando, where student castaways and hundreds of others traveled down Orange Avenue annually for years; it came back to dock permanently on campus in 2007.</p>

                	<p>It’s the stuff for kings and queens. For cruising in convertibles at two miles per hour. For making a splash outside President Hitt’s office. </p>
                    <p>At UCF, two particular Homecoming events are a wet and winding hit.</p>
                    <p>The annual Homecoming parade allows students to show off their creativity by decorating massive, themed floats and getting into character. Alumni get in on the act, too — sometimes riding in style after winning awards; other times sneakily merging in line and crashing the parade route (as rumor has it).  The parade began on campus for the Homecoming basketball games in the pre-football years, moved to downtown Orlando in the early 1990s and returned to campus with the opening of Bright House Networks Stadium in 2007.</p>
                    <p>And then there’s the student-fave, Spirit Splash. Ever wanted to bathe with hundreds of your closest friends? Well, that’s exactly the opportunity students get every year the Friday before the Homecoming football game.</p>
                    <p>UCF traditions have been around since floppy disks were floppy, hair was feathered and grills were on cars, not teeth. As the university continues to evolve, so will Knight traditions. One thing’s for sure, though, Knights will always be BGF (black and gold forever).</p>
                    <p class="gold">MORE TRADITIONS</p>
                    <p class="boldCaption">In the stomp, stomp, clap, clap, woosh — also known as the free throw chant — basketball fans hold up their right arms with clenched fists while a UCF player shoots a free throw. If the basket is made, fans stomp their feet twice, clap their hands twice and make a shooting motion with their right hands while saying “Woosh.” The stomp-clap-woosh is unique to UCF. Nobody else does it. The band started it on a rim cadence on the side of the drums, but officials told them they couldn’t do it anymore. But, by then, the fans had learned it and began doing it themselves.</p>
